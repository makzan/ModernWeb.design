In this project, we need you to build a tab content toggling component by using jQuery.

Use jQuery to create a tab components. Required 3 tabs and 3 content.

The 3 tabs are always shown.

By default, the first tab content is displayed. When end user clicks on the 2nd tab or the 3rd tab, their related tab content displayed. All other tab content should not be visible except the active tab.
